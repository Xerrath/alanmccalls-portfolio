Description of my Application for Bottega University Capstone Project:

I have decided to create a Full Stack Application utilizing React.js, HTML, SASS, JavaScript, with an API using Python on PostgreSQL Database.

This Application is intended for my personal use and growth tracking as it is a Portfolio of my own design utlizing react 18 Hooks Functional Components and no Sylizing Libraries.

Everything is custom styled and furthermore has custom functionality in a dynamic unique way. My goal was to make my database as dynamic as well where as someone else can utilize it to make their own portfolio there is a few changes I can make to make my portfolio more dynamic however at this time I do not see the purpose of this particular front end application needing it. (Things Such as adding more tables to allow a more customized settings and portfolio in a dynamic and easier way thus including (Name, Email update, Mission, skills Profile Picture update, and personal links)).

The Admin user can create USERS to testify on their behalf. The Admin user will be able to post and manage blogs / Users / Testimonials / and Projects for the Portfolio. Admins can choose to publish or not publish testimonies. A user can only manage their testimonies and can only testify on an admin users behalf.
To Create a Admin user you must go to (/create-admin-user) and will only be valid if the email is related to gmail ... However, I will be dissabling this because I want to restrict the load on my personal Application and who has access to it.

For any questions regarding my Full-Stack please contact me at mccall.alan.dee@gmail.com.

Thank you!
Alan

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
